title: Command-Line Interface (CLI) Options
---

This section of the documentations details all the Command-Line Interface (CLI)
options you have available at your disposal.

You can always run `forge --help` to get brief help on your CLI environment
itself but the said contents are subject to change. This section of the
documentations on the other hand will exist for posterity and will be the main
source of reference for the tool.

## Options

- `-V`, `--version`: Prints the version information of the tool.
- `list`: List all locally available templates.
- `template`: The name of template to download.
- `create`: Create a template for future reference.

:::note
The CLI options of the tool are subject to change and will be updated
without prior notice. This practice will continue until a stable and backwards
compatible version of the software is released.
